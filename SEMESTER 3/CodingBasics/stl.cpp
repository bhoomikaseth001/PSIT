/*Standard template library of generic classes and functions 
why use stl?? 1.We reuse well tested classes and functions
              2.Time savings
            
    Components of STL: Containers(vectors, lists,..)-> stores data, use template classes
                       Algorithm-> Sorting, Searching, Use template functions
                       Iterators -> object points to an element in a container, handled just like pointers, connects algo. with containers
                       
                       
    CONTAINERS: Sequence containers ->store data in linear fashion: vector, list, dequeue
                Associative containers -> direct access : set/ multiset, map/ multimap, dictionary
                Derived containers -> real world modelling : stack, queue, priority queue

              Sequence contains-> 
             1. VECTORS :           Random access=FAST
                                    Insertion/deletion =SLOW
                                    Insertion/deletion at the end =FAST
            2.  LIST :           Random access=SLOW
                                    Insertion/deletion =FAST
                                    Insertion/deletion at the end =FAST

            Association containers-> All operation very fast except RA
            Derives containers-> Depends -> data structure
